                treatise
                on Good and Evil. He used the book <br> to discuss his opinion on how <br> the philosophical schools of

                both him and St Jerome <br>
                caused him to be declared a "righteous pagan." Thus preserving <br> his works through Europe in the

                stayed as 'filler text' to this day.
