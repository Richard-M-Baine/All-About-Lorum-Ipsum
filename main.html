                Latin. <br> Where from though is beyond most people's
                recognition. Well as usual Wikipedia has the answer. <br> It is from a corrupted translation of a book
                called De finibus bonorum et malorum. <br> Loosely translated as "On the
                ends of good and evil."<br> This otherwise boring treatise has wormed itself into contemporary society.

                populated by people who studied everything<br>
                One of these people was Cicero. Born rich (a good start) he proceeded to run a real estate empire <br>
                when he was not lecturing in the Roman Senate. He was also considered an elite <br> philosopher whose
                writings were preserved by medieval christian<br>
                and Islamic scholars. He was eventually killed when he took the wrong side in Julius Caesar's political
                scheming.</p>
