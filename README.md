# firstwebsite
Probably a good demonstration website for someone learning HTML and CSS.  There are no glaring errors but perhaps fine tuning 
objects here or there could be good practice.  Another "project" could get rid of flex and rebuild it via grid etc.  Will be updating
periodically to beautify / improve.
